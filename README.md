# Todo-List App
I took this [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129445451/Lifetrack-To-do-App-Design-UIUX?tracking_source=search_projects%7Ctodo%20list%20ap) as an example
but since this project is commercial, I could not access files such as icons, fonts and others.
Then I found the icons on the internet and made this project inspired by that design.

### DESCRIPTION
I used firebase while doing the project. Users can register directly by going through certain verification processes. This user data is kept in firebase.
Also the todo list of users is kept in firestore database.

#### Things to do
- [ ] Firestore bugs will be fixed.
- [ ] Fix fonts.  
- [ ] Errors when listing user data will be fixed.
